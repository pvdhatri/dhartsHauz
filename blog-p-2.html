            collect your thoughts 
            and make the right decision. The city is so noisy and bustling that it suppresses the voice 
            of our heart. All you need is to find a piece of mind, hide from this clamor. And the place 
            you are looking for isn’t so far away. A web gallery may become your keepsake. It will help 
            you overcome agitation and will give you some new impressions and feelings. Observing art 
            online will definitely make you relieved and show you the right way.

                Art has a special influence on our soul. From classic canvases to 
                modern-day abstractions, it has always been one of the strongest emotional 
                drivers for us, humans. In the entire variety of its forms, it inspires us, 
                gives us comfort and encourages us to cherish our individuality. Is it any 
                wonder that art so often becomes an object of social taboo in post-apocalyptic 
                fiction? Without art, the world would have been so much duller! Don’t let your 
                wings wither and betray you! Fill your life with new colors beckoning to you 
                from the canvas and set out on an exciting trip to the bright world of art!

                                <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;"><i>A note for self,
                                    Dated – the day I was at my lowest
                                    For – every other day that feels like this.
                                    Note – there are beautiful things in this world, and you are one of them
                                    Go out for a walk with your dog and see how his tail wags
                                    And his eyes shine even though you take the same route everyday.
                                    Bake a cake for yourself
                                    If it goes... 
                                    <!-- bad, you can gobble it down with some cold coffee
                                    And if it turns out great, you have something to be proud of
                                    (Just make sure to clean the kitchen before Ma gets home).
                                    Read your favourite book and read out the dialogues like
                                    You did when you were younger
                                    Do the voices, do the modulation, bring props
                                    Be a child who has just got her Hogwarts acceptance letter again.
                                    Note – take care of yourself and the things that take care of you
                                    Take your bath, use that body scrub that cost a month’s allowance
                                    But it does smell great and feels great.
                                    Clean up your room, rearrange your bookshelf
                                    Make it alphabetically organized or make a rainbow out
                                    Of the spines.
                                    Fix the light in the corridor, fix the washing machine’s delay start
                                    Fix your creaky door, fix your leaking faucet.
                                    Note – everything does get better in the morning
                                    Before sleeping, think up a meet-cute with your celebrity crush
                                    And let your dream factory do the work
                                    Go to sleep as early as possible, or don’t sleep at all
                                    Catch the sunrise and work out for a little bit for a change
                                    Or try and count the stars and dance in the middle of the night.
                                    Note – the people who have been texting you and calling you
                                    Do really care about you
                                    Reply to that message, open that meme (maybe it is really funny)
                                    Listen to that song recommendation (it might become your new favorite)
                                    Video call that friend without a plan at hand and watch their
                                    Face light up when they see you.
                                    Note – take deep breaths and don’t forget to live. Just live.
                                    Take one step at a time, even though you may feel
                                    That you’re barely moving
                                    Take one breath at a time,
                                    A note for self – things WILL be okay. -->

                                    Romanticize waking up so early that it’s barely dawn and the sky is that
                                    Shade of blue that you can never find words for
                                    And it’s so quiet and you feel like you have the world to
                                    Yourself for a while
                                    Romanticize sleeping so late that you don’t know when
                                    Today ended and tomorrow began
                                    When you feel like...
                                    <!-- you can finally be at peace, when you
                                    Don’t have anything else to do, and so you fix your room
                                    Even though it’s already in order, or rearrange your jewelry
                                    Because who dare tell you what to do?
                                    Romanticize everything.
                                    Romanticize cooking for others, filling up with so much
                                    Indescribable joy when you see people’s eyes brightening
                                    Up when they eat something you made with your own hands
                                    When leftovers disappear into nothing and all that is left is
                                    Licked clean plates and happy stomachs
                                    Romanticize cooking for yourself, playing your favorite music
                                    As you dance around in your kitchen, your happy place
                                    Whether it be the gentle applaud of the tea brewing
                                    Or the sizzle of the garlic in hot oil,
                                    Or burning your toast just a little and compensating with
                                    A little extra peanut butter that day.
                                    Romanticize everything.
                                    Romanticize living with so many people in a tiny apartment
                                    That everyday is brushing shoulders and leaning over others
                                    To reach out to something, when there isn’t a quiet day
                                    And dinner means chairs joined together and endless laughter and love
                                    Romanticize living alone, in the apartment that may look
                                    Dark from the outside, but inside, you’ve created your own
                                    Little heaven, with plants that you have given names to
                                    With rugs and cushions from thrift stores that don’t really match
                                    The décor but make you happy.
                                    Romanticize everything.
                                    Romanticize one night stands, stolen stares across noisy bars
                                    Messy kisses in the taxi back to your place
                                    Clothes strewn everywhere and your sheets smelling like that
                                    Stranger and your little secret
                                    Romanticize true love, the person that you’ve known forever
                                    Yet still get excited about waking up to everyday
                                    Fights in the living room and dancing in the kitchen.
                                    Romanticize everything. Romanticize you. -->

        Art has a special influence on our soul. From classic canvases to 
        modern-day abstractions, it has always been one of the strongest emotional 
        drivers for us, humans. In the entire variety of its forms, it inspires us, 
        gives us comfort and encourages us to cherish our individuality. Is it any 
        wonder that art so often becomes an object of social taboo in post-apocalyptic 
        fiction? Without art, the world would have been so much duller! Don’t let your 
        wings wither and betray you! Fill your life with new colors beckoning to you 
        from the canvas and set out on an exciting trip to the bright world of art!
