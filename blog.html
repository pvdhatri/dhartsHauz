                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">November has arrived quietly, delicately, with the somber morning
                                Light spilling into my kitchen when I make my first cup of tea
                                And the wind, colder than I remember, gently teasing the
                                Corners of my face as if to tell me that I should step outside and
                                Welcome this month with open arms.
                                Something about November gives me hope
                                Something about the trees not being able to decide whether
                                To make its leaves shrivel and fall or to turn brilliant shades
                                Of yellow, orange and red
                                Something about the air, that smells like mint chocolate chip icecream
                                Something about the way I constantly feel like resting my head
                                Against windowpanes and breathing in the clean air
                                Against windows of the buses where the rain glitters the
                                Glass from the outside
                                Something about the way the gravel crunches with dry leaves
                                Each time you take a step as though it is keeping you company.</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">Okay, so here’s a confession
                            Each day I wake up and look at myself in the mirror
                            I see a stranger
                            I see someone whose flaws I can count at my fingertips –
                            Frizzy hair, pigmented skin, stretch marks, uneven limbs, love handles, strawberry spots, bruises and scars
                            I can do all of that as though the person in the mirror is
                            A stranger whom I’d never meet
                            Although all this hate ricocheted right back at me
                            And then I’d turn away and put a filter that would make
                            My skin look smoother, my eyes look brighter, my cheekbones sharper
                            And would take pictures as though I wasn’t lying to myself
                            And at least make myself believe that the person looking at these
                            Pictures would believe that I was perfect and I would at
                            Least convince one person of that, even though that
                            Person would never be me.
                            Okay, so here’s a confession
                            I love making plans and going out on lunch dates and
                            <!-- Drinking even when it’s bright daylight outside
                            And taking gazillion pictures with the ones I love
                            But then when someone asks if I want to go out for a drink or two
                            I shut down and say no and decide that I preferred
                            My own company and that a day spent in part sleeping, in part
                            Reading, and in part cleaning was my idea of perfect
                            And when asked why, I would just point fingers at my parents
                            Make them the villains, because it’s just easier that way.
                            Okay, so here’s a confession
                            When I was younger, I used to talk a lot
                            I’d incessantly chat, with someone, or something
                            Tell them about mundane things that I noticed
                            How I saw faces on the fronts of vehicles, how I saw shapes
                            In the clouds
                            Yet as each day passed, lesser and lesser people listened
                            And I was then told that my talking was annoying, that
                            My opinions didn’t matter and that
                            Some things are best left to be kept inside
                            And so when I grew up, I stopped talking like before
                            Always afraid of sounding silly or boring or stupid
                            Because I realized that around people, you must not be yourself,
                            No, you must be someone who has no blemishes
                            Someone who always has plans
                            Someone who only speaks sense
                            Someone, who is only a shell of who you really are.</p> -->

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">Giving a shout out to the great season of Autumn!
                            I mean look at all the colors splashed among nature! 
                            One project that I created with my second grade students was inspired by the Avenues of Poplars by Vincent Van Gogh. Yes my friends, you can teach one point perspective to young students and not pull out your hair!
                            As I said, the inspiration was this delightful painting Vincent created in the fall. What he wrote to his brother Theo, “with yellow autumn leaves and the sun casting here and there”, struck a chord in my heart. Vincent is really describing the beauty of Autumn and I wanted that beautiful description to be put down on paper. 
                            This mixed media project uses oil pastels, tempera paints and chalks with painted paper scraps to create an adorable cottage in the woods.</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">If I could bundle up all my emotions and
                            The unsaid words and the things that can’t really be expressed
                            That I have felt this past one year
                            It will perhaps sound like a cacophony of sounds. Of screams. Of anguish.
                            Of frustration. Of boredom. Of missing people. Of missing human contact.
                            And in the background of all this chaos, you will find my
                            Heart beating, constantly, like it always does, unaffected. 
                            But I have also learnt that that’s okay
                            It’s okay to not be put together all the time
                            It’s okay to want to scream your lungs out at the universe and
                            The world and the gods that you’re supposed to worship
                            And the people you’re supposed to love.
                            It’s all okay
                            Because we are human, after all, and if losing the most wonderful
                            Person in my life has taught me anything, it is that
                            Life is too damn short to not truly feel what you’re feeling.
                            So again, if I could sum up all that’s happened this past year
                            I would perhaps let out a sigh
                            A sigh that means a million things
                            A sigh made up of sleepless nights and anxious dooms
                            A sigh made up of wonderful evenings with my plants who
                            Loved that I was constantly at home
                            A sigh made up of love and loss and happiness and despair
                            A sigh made up of human nature.</p>
