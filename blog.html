                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px;">If I could bundle up all my emotions and
                            the unsaid words and the things that can’t really be expressed
                            that I have felt this past one year
                            it will perhaps sound like a cacophony of sounds, of screams, of anguish,
                            of frustration, of boredom, of missing people, of missing human contact.
                            And in the background of all this chaos, you will find my
                            heart beating, constantly, like it always does, unaffected. 
                            But I have also learnt that that’s okay
                            it’s okay to not be put together all the time
                            it’s okay to want to scream your lungs out at the universe and
                            the world and the gods that you’re supposed to worship
                            and the people you’re supposed to love.
                            It’s all okay
                            because we are human, after all, and if losing the most wonderful
                            person in my life has taught me anything, it is that
                            life is too damn short to not truly feel what you’re feeling.
                            So again, if I could sum up all that’s happened this past year
                            I would perhaps let out a sigh
                            a sigh that means a million things
                            a sigh made up of sleepless nights and anxious dooms
                            a sigh made up of wonderful evenings with my plants who
                            Loved that I was constantly at home
                            a sigh made up of love and loss and happiness and despair
                            a sigh made up of human nature.</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px;">November has arrived quietly, delicately, with the somber morning
                                light spilling into my kitchen when I make my first cup of tea
                                and the wind, colder than I remember, gently teasing the
                                corners of my face as if to tell me that I should step outside and
                                welcome this month with open arms.
                                Something about November gives me hope
                                something about the trees not being able to decide whether
                                to make its leaves shrivel and fall or to turn brilliant shades
                                of yellow, orange and red
                                something about the air, that smells like mint chocolate chip icecream
                                something about the way I constantly feel like resting my head
                                against windowpanes and breathing in the clean air
                                against windows of the buses where the rain glitters the
                                glass from the outside
                                something about the way the gravel crunches with dry leaves
                                each time you take a step as though it is...</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px;">Okay, so here’s a confession.
                            Each day I wake up and look at myself in the mirror
                            I see a stranger
                            I see someone whose flaws I can count at my fingertips –
                            frizzy hair, pigmented skin, stretch marks, uneven limbs, love handles, strawberry spots, bruises and scars
                            I can do all of that as though the person in the mirror is
                            A stranger whom I’d never meet
                            although all this hate ricocheted right back at me
                            and then I’d turn away and put a filter that would make
                            my skin look smoother, my eyes look brighter, my cheekbones sharper
                            and would take pictures as though I wasn’t lying to myself
                            and at least make myself believe that the person looking at these
                            pictures would believe that I was perfect and I would at
                            least convince one person of that, even though that
                            person would never be me.
                            okay, so here’s a confession
                            I love making plans and going out on lunch dates and...</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px;">March makes me think of the colour green.
                            It is when trees that have
                            shed their leaves in the harsh cold, the way we let go
                            of people whom we love and want to hold on to
                            but they become too heavy for us and so I suppose this
                            month means bringing new people into our lives
                            the kind that make us hold our head high and not
                            droop with despair.
                            March makes me think of skirts
                            the kind that frame your body in such a way that you
                            feel like you belong not to an age where people barely
                            look up from their phones, but instead the Jazz Age, where
                            the dresses had fringes because it meant more fun and
                            gatsby held parties all night long because the air was just
                            a little more sweet at night in the month of March.
                            March makes me think of school...
                            <!-- the way my heart would beat faster and faster as... the exams
                            arrived and yet there was something wonderful about
                            tt. Wonderful in the way we took new pens to school
                            and watched them glide over those answer sheets, hoping, just hoping
                            that we make it through
                            and we do, we always do, and we emerge, albeit a little dented
                            but ready to take on a new year and to make a new set
                            of memories.
                            March makes me think of colours
                            of vibrant hues of magenta and vermillion and emerald
                            smeared against each other’s faces, screams of laughter
                            and threats of throwing water balloons and it all becomes
                            A time when no matter what age you are, the child in you
                            comes out to play.
                            March makes me think of flower buds
                            the ones that my mother agonizes over day in and day out
                            speaking to them as though they were her own children
                            and watering them carefully, watching them grow and
                            beaming as the first bud gives way for a flower to bloom
                            for this is the month of rebirths and new beginnings
                            of starting over and forgiving oneself for the things that
                            we haven’t been able to achieve.
                            March makes me think of dreaming
                            something that we do during our afternoon naps
                            with a thin sheet over us while the fan rotates at a steady
                            pace, almost singing a lullaby
                            and we dream of running across lush fields, barefoot
                            and dream of warmer climes and sunnier days.</p> -->
