                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">March makes me think of the colour green.
                            It is when trees that have
                            shed their leaves in the harsh cold, the way we let go
                            of people whom we love and want to hold on to
                            but they become too heavy for us and so I suppose this
                            month means bringing new people into our lives
                            the kind that make us hold our head high and not
                            droop with despair.
                            March makes me think of skirts
                            the kind that frame your body in such a way that you
                            feel like you belong not to an age where people barely
                            look up from their phones, but instead the Jazz Age, where
                            the dresses had fringes because it meant more fun and
                            gatsby held parties all night long because the air was just
                            a little more sweet at night in the month of March.
                            March makes me think of school
                            the way my heart would beat faster and faster as the exams
                            arrived and yet there was something wonderful about
                            tt. Wonderful in the way we took new pens to school
                            and watched them glide over those answer sheets, hoping, just hoping
                            that we make it through
                            and we do, we always do, and we emerge, albeit a little dented
                            but ready to take on a new year and to make a new set
                            of memories.
                            March makes me think of colours
                            of vibrant hues of magenta and vermillion and emerald
                            smeared against each other’s faces, screams of laughter
                            and threats of throwing water balloons and it all becomes
                            a time when no matter what age you are, the child in you
                            comes out to play.
                            March makes me think of flower buds
                            the ones that my mother agonizes over day in and day out
                            speaking to them as though they were her own children
                            and watering them carefully, watching them grow and
                            beaming as the first bud gives way for a flower to bloom
                            for this is the month of rebirths and new beginnings
                            of starting over and forgiving oneself for the things that
                            we haven’t been able to achieve.
                            March makes me think of dreaming
                            something that we do during our afternoon naps
                            with a thin sheet over us while the fan rotates at a steady
                            pace, almost singing a lullaby
                            and we dream of running across lush fields, barefoot
                            and dream of warmer climes and sunnier days.</p>
