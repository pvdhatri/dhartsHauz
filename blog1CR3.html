                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">Okay, so here’s a confession.
                            Each day I wake up and look at myself in the mirror
                            I see a stranger
                            I see someone whose flaws I can count at my fingertips –
                            frizzy hair, pigmented skin, stretch marks, uneven limbs, love handles, strawberry spots, bruises and scars
                            I can do all of that as though the person in the mirror is
                            A stranger whom I’d never meet
                            although all this hate ricocheted right back at me
                            and then I’d turn away and put a filter that would make
                            my skin look smoother, my eyes look brighter, my cheekbones sharper
                            and would take pictures as though I wasn’t lying to myself
                            and at least make myself believe that the person looking at these
                            pictures would believe that I was perfect and I would at
                            least convince one person of that, even though that
                            person would never be me.
                            okay, so here’s a confession
                            I love making plans and going out on lunch dates and
                            drinking even when it’s bright daylight outside
                            and taking gazillion pictures with the ones I love
                            but then when someone asks if I want to go out for a drink or two
                            I shut down and say no and decide that I preferred
                            my own company and that a day spent in part sleeping, in part
                            reading, and in part cleaning was my idea of perfect
                            and when asked why, I would just point fingers at my parents
                            make them the villains, because it’s just easier that way.
                            Okay, so here’s a confession
                            when I was younger, I used to talk a lot
                            I’d incessantly chat, with someone, or something
                            tell them about mundane things that I noticed
                            how I saw faces on the fronts of vehicles, how I saw shapes
                            in the clouds
                            yet as each day passed, lesser and lesser people listened
                            and I was then told that my talking was annoying, that
                            my opinions didn’t matter and that
                            some things are best left to be kept inside
                            and so when I grew up, I stopped talking like before
                            always afraid of sounding silly or boring or stupid
                            because I realized that around people, you must not be yourself,
                            no, you must be someone who has no blemishes
                            someone who always has plans
                            someone who only speaks sense
                            someone, who is only a shell of who you really are.</p>
