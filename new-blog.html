                                <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;"> <i>January brought along overcast days and almost rainy skies
                                    And I wondered what name I could give the love I have for you
                                    Because l-o-v-e seems too fragile a word for something that
                                    Is so tempestuous and soothing at the same time. February came almost like a whisper, like a...
                                    <!--mother waking you
                                    On a late Sunday, smelling of waffles and mangoes
                                    And I wondered if this pain I felt inside me, in the deepest crevices
                                    Of my heart, was something that really hurt or was it something I welcomed?
                                    March arrived almost like a soothing balm
                                    Thawing my heart from the little flickers of sunshine it poured
                                    Down and I, watching you, realized what it meant to love
                                    All parts of a person, and how you, like me, craved sunshine
                                    And became warmer to touch and so I lingered in hugs and
                                    You never let go.
                                    April, May, June and July went by so fast that I didn’t know
                                    When one began and one ended because they were right
                                    When they said that summer is for lovers and I have never
                                    Felt more loved than being in your arms, having every
                                    Flavour of ice cream we could find and squiggling our toes into
                                    The sand.
                                    August and September and October were the months
                                    I knew I had to let you go because what good ever really stays forever
                                    And I remember holding on to you so tight during those rainy nights
                                    That I hoped that the hammering of the rain against the windows
                                    Would mask the sound of heart screaming out the same thing
                                    Again and again
                                    Stay. Stay. Stay. Won’t you stay?
                                    November came and so came the cold
                                    And you packed your bags and I saw the twinkle in your eyes
                                    That I adore so damn much, dwindle with each passing day
                                    As if you’d named a star for each milestone of our love
                                    In your eyes and now they were all dimming.
                                    December rushed in like an uninvited stranger and I still held
                                    The door open because when you love someone, you love them
                                    Enough to let them go, and so I did
                                    I kissed you one last time and told you to take care
                                    And whispered, hoping you’d hear
                                    That January wasn’t too far away.</i></p> -->

                        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px;">March makes me think of the colour green.
                            It is when trees that have
                            shed their leaves in the harsh cold, the way we let go
                            of people whom we love and want to hold on to
                            but they become too heavy for us and so I suppose this
                            month means bringing new people into our lives
                            the kind that make us hold our head high and not
                            droop with despair.
                            March makes me think of skirts
                            the kind that frame your body in such a way that you
                            feel like you belong not to an age where people barely
                            look up from their phones, but instead the Jazz Age, where
                            the dresses had fringes because it meant more fun and
                            gatsby held parties all night long because the air was just
                            a little more sweet at night in the month of March.
                            March makes me think of school...
                            the way my heart would beat faster and faster as... the exams
                            arrived and yet there was something wonderful about
                            tt. Wonderful in the way we took new pens to school
                            and watched them glide over those answer sheets, hoping, just hoping
                            that we make it through
                            and we do, we always do, and we emerge, albeit a little dented
                            but ready to take on a new year and to make a new set
                            of memories.
                            March makes me think of colours
                            of vibrant hues of magenta and vermillion and emerald
                            smeared against each other’s faces, screams of laughter
                            and threats of throwing water balloons and it all becomes
                            A time when no matter what age you are, the child in you
                            comes out to play.
                            March makes me think of flower buds
                            the ones that my mother agonizes over day in and day out
                            speaking to them as though they were her own children
                            and watering them carefully, watching them grow and
                            beaming as the first bud gives way for a flower to bloom
                            for this is the month of rebirths and new beginnings
                            of starting over and forgiving oneself for the things that
                            we haven’t been able to achieve.
                            March makes me think of dreaming
                            something that we do during our afternoon naps
                            with a thin sheet over us while the fan rotates at a steady
                            pace, almost singing a lullaby
                            and we dream of running across lush fields, barefoot
                            and dream of warmer climes and sunnier days.</p>
