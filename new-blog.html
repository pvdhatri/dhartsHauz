            collect your thoughts 
            and make the right decision. The city is so noisy and bustling that it suppresses the voice 
            of our heart. All you need is to find a piece of mind, hide from this clamor. And the place 
            you are looking for isn’t so far away. A web gallery may become your keepsake. It will help 
            you overcome agitation and will give you some new impressions and feelings. Observing art 
            online will definitely make you relieved and show you the right way.

                Art has a special influence on our soul. From classic canvases to 
                modern-day abstractions, it has always been one of the strongest emotional 
                drivers for us, humans. In the entire variety of its forms, it inspires us, 
                gives us comfort and encourages us to cherish our individuality. Is it any 
                wonder that art so often becomes an object of social taboo in post-apocalyptic 
                fiction? Without art, the world would have been so much duller! Don’t let your 
                wings wither and betray you! Fill your life with new colors beckoning to you 
                from the canvas and set out on an exciting trip to the bright world of art!

                                <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;"><i>January brought along overcast days and almost rainy skies
                                    And I wondered what name I could give the love I have for you
                                    Because l-o-v-e seems too fragile a word for something that
                                    Is so tempestuous and soothing at the same time. February came almost like a whisper, like a...
                                    mother waking you
                                    On a late Sunday, smelling of 
                                    <!--waffles and mangoes
                                    And I wondered if this pain I felt inside me, in the deepest crevices
                                    Of my heart, was something that really hurt or was it something I welcomed?
                                    March arrived almost like a soothing balm
                                    Thawing my heart from the little flickers of sunshine it poured
                                    Down and I, watching you, realized what it meant to love
                                    All parts of a person, and how you, like me, craved sunshine
                                    And became warmer to touch and so I lingered in hugs and
                                    You never let go.
                                    April, May, June and July went by so fast that I didn’t know
                                    When one began and one ended because they were right
                                    When they said that summer is for lovers and I have never
                                    Felt more loved than being in your arms, having every
                                    Flavour of ice cream we could find and squiggling our toes into
                                    The sand.
                                    August and September and October were the months
                                    I knew I had to let you go because what good ever really stays forever
                                    And I remember holding on to you so tight during those rainy nights
                                    That I hoped that the hammering of the rain against the windows
                                    Would mask the sound of heart screaming out the same thing
                                    Again and again
                                    Stay. Stay. Stay. Won’t you stay?
                                    November came and so came the cold
                                    And you packed your bags and I saw the twinkle in your eyes
                                    That I adore so damn much, dwindle with each passing day
                                    As if you’d named a star for each milestone of our love
                                    In your eyes and now they were all dimming.
                                    December rushed in like an uninvited stranger and I still held
                                    The door open because when you love someone, you love them
                                    Enough to let them go, and so I did
                                    I kissed you one last time and told you to take care
                                    And whispered, hoping you’d hear
                                    That January wasn’t too far away. -->

                                    I can do all of that as though...</i></p>

                                <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;"><i>I fall in love with everything
                                    And everyone
                                    And every feeling that exists.
                                    I know that people say that you shouldn’t love everything
                                    Because nothing exists forever, and so won’t your love for it
                                    I know that people say that you shouldn’t love everyone
                                    Because love is a scam, and we are all going to die alone anyway
                                    I know that...
                                    <!-- people say that you shouldn’t love every feeling
                                    Because the chances of you getting hurt increases manifold.
                                    But I do believe in a greater something, that there is a holiness
                                    Beyond all of us, that transcends all our beliefs and notions
                                    And is separate from all our differences and opinions
                                    And that is love.
                                    I am in love with laughter. How everyone laughs a different way
                                    And that when people laugh, really laugh, it’s a more intimate
                                    Thing than taking your clothes off in front of a stranger
                                    Because that laughter heals you down to your roots.
                                    I am in love with nature. How it is everlasting and yet so fragile
                                    How clouds can be fluffy and shades of pastel blues and pinks
                                    But can also turn tempestuous and hues of vivid greys
                                    How the colour green can have a thousand shades and more
                                    And how it soothes when you caress a plant and it’s as though
                                    There’s some unspoken promise between the plants in your
                                    House and you, that you care for them, and they’ll make
                                    Your house a home
                                    How seasons change, sometimes gradually, and sometimes all
                                    At once, how they can make you think of icecream, the smell
                                    Of wet earth, the chill of cold air, the sweetness of a dewy morning
                                    And make you feel happy and sad and lonely and loved all at once.
                                    I am in love with art. The messy kind, the kind that leaves
                                    Your favourite clothes stained with paint,
                                    The cryptic kind, the kind that means different things to different people
                                    The kind that exists on people, tattoos on skin, like a separate
                                    Layer of words and images we can never really express,
                                    Coloured hair, like all the colours of the rainbow on a person.
                                    I am in love with everything, and everyone, and
                                    On nights when I feel the loneliest, or days when everything else
                                    Seems to be blurry,
                                    I try to find a little love for myself. -->

                                <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;"><i>Listen to me.
                                    Take a deep breath. Unclench your jaw.
                                    Open your fists. Turn your phone off. Relax your shoulders.
                                    I know that this country, this world, all of us are on fire
                                    And that you are filled with this hopeless dread
                                    One that seems so familiar, like it had just brushed past you
                                    A little while ago and is back with a vengeance, but...
                                    <!-- Listen to me
                                    Listen when I say that you have incredible power in your hands
                                    And your voice and your soul
                                    But that it’s okay to feel powerless, that it’s okay to take a break.
                                    Listen to me.
                                    Don’t compare your grief to the grief of someone who has lost
                                    Their loved ones. Their pain might be greater on some
                                    Undefined scale, yes, but your pain is just as valid.
                                    You are valid, and so is the inexplicable volcano bubbling inside you
                                    That just wants to burst and find some magic button to end this all
                                    But you listen to me
                                    Listen when I say that you are not made up of pieces
                                    That you have to hold together, shabbily put together with
                                    Duct tape and willpower
                                    Listen to me when I say that it’s okay to let go
                                    It’s okay to open your window or your front door or go out
                                    To your terrace and just scream fuck you!
                                    Cuss our whoever you want to, because yes, this is unfair
                                    Yes, this is out of your hands
                                    Yes, this is horrible and painful and uncontrollable
                                    And yes, you are allowed your share of that pain.
                                    Listen to me
                                    I haven’t stepped out of the house in god knows how long
                                    But I’ve made peace with that because I’ve learnt so many
                                    New things
                                    I’ve learnt that my father has a secret stash of jokes that
                                    He reserves only for when things get really bad
                                    I’ve learnt that my mother has a happy dance that she does
                                    That makes me want to get up and dance with her even
                                    If there is no music on
                                    I’ve learnt that my dog loves being scratched on the bridge
                                    Of his nose and that I am the person he always loves
                                    Sitting next to
                                    And I know that having learnt all these things isn’t going
                                    To save the world, but that’s okay
                                    Because listen.
                                    That when everything goes back to normal and the fires are put out,
                                    You’ll be glad you gave yourself some time to slow down. -->

            Art has a special influence on our soul. From classic canvases to 
            modern-day abstractions, it has always been one of the strongest emotional 
            drivers for us, humans. In the entire variety of its forms, it inspires us, 
            gives us comfort and encourages us to cherish our individuality. Is it any 
            wonder that art so often becomes an object of social taboo in post-apocalyptic 
            fiction? Without art, the world would have been so much duller! Don’t let your 
            wings wither and betray you! Fill your life with new colors beckoning to you 
            from the canvas and set out on an exciting trip to the bright world of art!
